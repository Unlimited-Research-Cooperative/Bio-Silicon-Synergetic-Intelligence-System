# CNN Feature Extraction

We aim to accurately predict features from signal data using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) so that we can speed up the computionally expensive task of computing these features. 

We currently compute these features nightly since they are computionally expensive, but if we are able to speed this process up, we can use these features directly in the BCI system and analyze the live BCI system as a whole using these features.
